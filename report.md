# Report: Ozean Poseidon Testnet Bridge Issue

When using the OP Standard Bridge to transfer tokens from Sepolia (L1) to Ozean Poseidon Testnet (L2), the L1 bridge transaction completes successfully, but the corresponding tokens never appear on L2. According to the OP Stack documentation, L1 to L2 transactions should typically be processed within 1-3 minutes, but even after waiting 24+ hours, the bridged tokens don't appear on the L2.

### Evidence

1. **L1 Transaction Trace**: The L1 transaction trace shows that the bridging process on L1 completed successfully:

   - Token transfer to the L1 Standard Bridge contract was successful
   - `ERC20DepositInitiated` and `ERC20BridgeInitiated` events were emitted
   - The message was properly sent to the L2 via the `OptimismPortal`

2. **L2 Explorer**: Examination of the L2 Standard Bridge contract on Ozean Explorer (`https://poseidon-testnet.explorer.caldera.xyz/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010`) shows:
   - No corresponding token transfer for this bridge transaction
   - Other bridge transactions (mostly withdrawals) are visible
   - Zero token transfers recorded

### My Analysis

The issue appears to be on the Ozean Poseidon testnet's sequencer side. In the OP Stack architecture:

1. When bridging from L1 to L2:
   - L1 tokens are locked in the L1 Standard Bridge
   - A message is sent to the L2 via the OptimismPortal contract
   - The sequencer should pick up this message and execute it on L2
   - The L2 Standard Bridge should mint the corresponding tokens on L2

2. Failure points:
   - The sequencer may not be correctly processing or detecting the deposit transactions from L1
   - There could be configuration issues in the deposit detection mechanism
   - The L2 Standard Bridge contract might have issues processing the incoming messages
